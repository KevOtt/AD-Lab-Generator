# This config file specifies the groups the AD Lab Generator will use
# Groups should be specified, one per line, in the format "GroupName,Type"
# The Lab Generator uses "role groups" and "access group" types to mimick an RBAC model
# By default, some of both kinds will need to be specified. Names must follow AD conventions.
# Lines beginning with "#" are comment lines
